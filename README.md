## Summary
This version of the classic snake game helps you adjust your level to the game and not vice versa. You can add sidelines, mines and even manipulate the size of the game. 

At first glance this game seams incredibly simple, but after diving in, I really started to see it's complexity. I learned tons about data relation and gaming conceps in vanillas javascript.
